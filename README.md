# Monty ALX

## Authors

## Description
Monty ALX is a project developed by Misheck Gogo and Wayne R Masakure for the ALX software engineering program. It aims to implement a simple interpreter for Monty bytecode files. This project demonstrates a basic understanding of stack data structures, algorithms, and low-level programming concepts.

## Features
- Interprets Monty bytecode instructions
- Supports various stack operations
- Error handling and reporting

## Files
- `monty.c`: Main source file for the Monty interpreter.
- `stack.c`, `queue.c`: Files containing stack and queue operations, respectively.
- `monty.h`: Header file with function prototypes and struct declarations.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/Monty-ALX.git
Compile the program:
bash
Copy code
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o monty
Run the interpreter:
bash
Copy code
./monty bytecode_file.m
Replace bytecode_file.m with the path to your Monty bytecode file.
Example
Suppose you have a Monty bytecode file named example.m containing the following instructions:

Copy code
push 1
push 2
push 3
pall
Running the interpreter with this file will output:
